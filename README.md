# SPC Supplier Management System

Through this project, I have digitized the method of obtaining medicine through the tenders of the State Pharmaceutical Cooperation (SPC).  Companies that want to submit tenders have to create a profile in this system.  That way, they can view a list of medicines for which tenders have been invited.
